# deepLearning
Different projects I developed with my team for the deep learning subject at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid. We developed an image recognition program that we would keep updating with what was taught in the lectures. We started with a Feed Forward Neural Network and then we would experiment with Convolutional Neural Networks, as well as pretraining our model with a preestablished neural network such as ResNet50, among others.
